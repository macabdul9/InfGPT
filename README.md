# âˆžGPT: Training Large Language Models For Any-To-Any Generation

This is course project for 11-785: Introduction to Deep Learning (Fall 2025) at Carnegie Mellon University. Please find the project [report](InfGPT.pdf) which documents the details of the project.
The project is focused on training large language models for any-to-any generation tasks, including multimodal tasks involving images and speech.

## Scripts

### Evaluation Scripts
- **`eval_mmmu.py`**  
  Evaluates `MMMU` tasks in a constrained setting.  
  Supports token-based evaluation of instruction-response tasks.

- **`eval_mmmu_gen.py`**  
  Performs generation-based evaluation for `MMMU` tasks.  
  Focuses on free-form responses.

- **`eval_speech.py`**  
  Evaluates speech tasks with pre-tokenized audio data in a constrained manner.  
  Uses prompts tailored for speech-to-text evaluation.

- **`eval_speech_gen.py`**  
  Performs free-form generation-based evaluation for speech tasks.  
  Handles tasks dynamically with multiple datasets.

### Tokenization Scripts
- **`speech_tokenization.py`**  
  Tokenizes audio files for speech tasks.  
  Outputs tokenized representations for use in evaluations.

- **`image_tokenization.py`**  
  Tokenizes image data for image-based tasks.  
  Supports multimodal evaluations.

### Shell Scripts
- **`eval_mmmu.sh` / `eval_mmmu_gen.sh`**  
  Shell scripts to run `MMMU` evaluations.

- **`eval_speech.sh` / `eval_speech_gen.sh`**  
  Shell scripts to run speech evaluations.

- **`tokenize_image_audio.sh`**  
  Script for tokenizing both image and audio data.

### Other Scripts
- **`inference.py`**  
  General inference script for running models on various tasks.

- **`anygpt_install.sh`**  
  Script to install dependencies and set up the environment.
