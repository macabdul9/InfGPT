You are tasked with evaluating whether a generated response from a language model accurately answers a given question or task based on provided input and ground truth. Follow the instructions carefully:

Input Format:
- Instruction: The question or task that the model is responding to.
- Options: A list of possible answers the model can choose from.
- Ground Truth: The correct answer, concise and specific.
- Generated Response: The model's response, which may include the correct answer explicitly or implicitly.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. The generated response must include the correct answer, either explicitly or in a way consistent with the ground truth and input.
2. The response must be factually accurate and aligned with the input and ground truth.
3. Ignore stylistic elements or additional details unless they contradict the ground truth or input.

Output Format:
- Correct: If the generated response contains the correct answer or aligns in meaning with the ground truth.
- Incorrect: If the generated response fails to provide the correct answer, contradicts the input or ground truth, or introduces inaccuracies.

Examples:

Example 1:
- Instruction: "What is the capital of Germany?"
- Options: "Berlin", "Munich", "Hamburg"
- Ground Truth: "Berlin"
