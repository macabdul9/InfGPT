## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Given the following audio file, write a python program to identify the different types of sounds used.

### Ideas

- The audio file could contain sounds of an animal, machine, music, etc.
- You can use the `scipy` library to read the audio file and extract the different types of sounds.

### Solution

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.io import wavfile

# read the audio file
sample_rate, data = wavfile.read('audio.wav')

# identify the different types of sounds
animal_sounds = []
machine_sounds = []
music_sounds = []
for i in range(0, len(data), 1000):
    sound = data[i:i+1000]
    if np.mean(sound) > 500:
        animal_sounds.append(sound)
    elif np.mean(sound) < 100:
        machine_sounds.append(sound)
    else:
        music_sounds.append(sound)

# print the results
print(""Animal Sounds: "", animal_sounds)
print(""Machine Sounds: "", machine_sounds)
print(""Music Sounds: "", music_sounds)

Title: The Amazing Power of Speech Recognition

Speech recognition is a cool technology that helps computers understand what we say. It works by using special software to analyze the sound waves of our voices and convert them into words. This technology is like having a super-smart assistant that can understand us and help us with many tasks.

One way speech recognition can be used is in making phone calls. Instead of typing out the number on the keypad, we can simply speak it into the phone and the software will recognize the words and dial the number for us. This is really helpful because it saves time and makes it easier for people who have difficulty typing.

Another way speech recognition is used is in computers. Have you ever wanted to search for something on the internet, but you didn't know the right word? With speech recognition, you can just speak the word out loud and the computer will try to find it for you. It's like having a really smart friend who knows everything!

Speech recognition is also used in dictation. This means that instead of typing out a document, we can speak it into the computer and it will transcribe our words into text. This is useful for people who are too busy to type or have difficulty using a keyboard.

But even though speech recognition is amazing, it does have some limitations. Sometimes, the software may not understand what we are saying, especially if we have a strong accent or speak too quickly. It's like trying to talk to someone who speaks a different language. We need to make sure we speak clearly and slowly for the software to understand us.

Another challenge of speech recognition is that it can be affected by background noise. Have you ever tried to have a conversation in a noisy place and it was hard to hear each other? Well, the same thing can happen with speech recognition. If there is too much noise around, the software may not be able to understand what we are saying.

Despite these challenges, speech recognition is still a very useful technology. It helps people with disabilities to communicate more easily and it makes tasks like calling and searching for information much faster and simpler. It's like having a personal assistant who listens to us and does our bidding!

Exercise 1: Can you think of a time when speech recognition could",Incorrect
"Perceive the action conveyed through the spoken words. The answer could be activate, bring, change language, deactivate, decrease, or increase.",A. activate B. change language C. deactivate D. bring E. decrease F. increase,decrease,"### Reasoning:
1. The input audio contains a series of spoken words, represented as a sequence of audio samples.
2. To convert this sequence of audio samples into text, we can use a speech recognition system.
3. The speech recognition system can be trained on a large corpus of text and audio samples to learn the relationship between spoken words and their corresponding written form.
4. Once the speech recognition system has been trained, it can be used to transcribe the spoken words in the input audio.
5. The resulting transcribed text can then be processed further to extract information or perform other tasks, depending on the specific application.

### Example:
For example, suppose we have a text-to-speech system that uses speech recognition to convert spoken words into text. If we were given the input audio sequence described above, we could use a trained speech recognition system to transcribe the spoken words into text as follows:

```
import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize the speech recognition object
r = sr.Recognizer()

# Define the audio file
audio = sr.AudioFile(""input.wav"")

# Load the audio file
with audio as source:
    # Listen for the spoken words in the audio
    with r.listen(source) as audio_data:
        # Recognize the spoken words in the audio
        text = r.recognize_google(audio_data)

# Print the transcribed text
print(text)
```

This code uses the `speech_recognition` library to load an audio file and transcribe the spoken words in the file using Google's speech recognition API. The resulting transcribed text can then be processed further to extract information or perform other tasks, depending on the specific application.",Incorrect

This script uses the Google Speech Recognition API to convert an audio file to text. The audio file must be in the default format (WAV) and located in the same directory as the script. The recognized text is then printed to the console.

### Task:Speech2Text

### Instruction:
Create a function that takes a list of audio files as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the file names and the values are the recognized text from the corresponding files.

### Input:
A list of audio files.

### Response:

```python
# Solution
import speech_recognition as sr

def speech_to_text(audio_files):
    # Initialize the audio files dictionary
    audio_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate through the audio files
    for file in audio_files:
        # Initialize the audio file
        r = sr.Recognizer()

        # Convert the audio to text
        text = r.recognize_google(audio)
        
        # Add the audio file name and text to the dictionary
        audio_dict[file] = text
        
    return audio_dict

# Test the function
audio_files = ['input1.wav', 'input2.wav', 'input3.wav']
audio_dict = speech_to_text(audio_files)
print(audio_dict)
```

This script creates a function called `speech_to_text` that takes a list of audio files as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the file names and the values are the recognized text from the corresponding files. The recognized text is obtained using the Google Speech Recognition API. The function is then tested with a list of audio files and the resulting dictionary is printed to the console.

### Explanation:
The instruction is to discern the action conveyed through the speech. The answer is ""activate"" because the speaker's tone and inflection suggest an intention to turn on something. The input provides audio data of a conversation between two people, with the speaker in the <aud_00068> channel. 

### Additional steps:
To complete the request, the student should listen to the audio data and analyze the speaker's tone and inflection. They should then identify the word that best conveys the speaker's intention.

1. How would the answer change if the input audio data was of a conversation between two people discussing the weather?
2. What other factors could influence the speaker's intention in this scenario?
3. How would you verify your answer in a real-world scenario? 

### Solution to follow-up exercises:
1. The answer would change if the input audio data was of a conversation between two people discussing the weather because the speaker's tone and inflection would suggest a different intention. 
2. Other factors that could influence the speaker's intention in this scenario include the location, time of day, and context of the conversation. 
3. To verify your answer in a real-world scenario, you could observe the speaker's actions to confirm whether they are indeed performing the action they intend to perform.",Incorrect

"Determine the action behind the spoken words. The answer could be activate, bring, change language, deactivate, decrease, or increase.",A. activate B. change language C. deactivate D. bring E. decrease F. increase,decrease,"The action behind the spoken words is to increase.

Explanation:

In the given input, the speaker says the words ""Increase"". The action being requested is to increase, as indicated by the verb 'increase' used in the input. This is a common action that is used to make a change in a variable or a quantity. 

Follow-up exercise 1:
What would be the appropriate action if the speaker says the words ""Decrease"" instead?

Solution:
The appropriate action if the speaker says the words ""Decrease"" instead is to decrease.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the action being requested is to decrease. This is indicated by the verb 'decrease' used in the input. This is a common action that is used to make a change in a variable or a quantity. 

Follow-up exercise 2:
What would be the appropriate action if the speaker says the words ""Activate"" instead?

Solution:
The appropriate action if the speaker says the words ""Activate"" instead is to activate.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the action being requested is to activate. This is indicated by the verb 'activate' used in the input. This is a common action that is used to make a change in a variable or a quantity. 

Follow-up exercise 3:
What would be the appropriate action if the speaker says the words ""Decrease"" and ""Increase"" alternately in a sequence?

Solution:
The appropriate action if the speaker says the words ""Decrease"" and ""Increase"" alternately in a sequence would be to decrease for the first action and then increase for the next action.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the speaker says ""Decrease"" and ""Increase"" alternately in a sequence. The action being requested for the first action is to decrease, and for the second action, the action being requested is to increase. This is a common pattern where two actions are performed in a sequence, with the first action being different from the second action.",Incorrect
"Identify the action behind the spoken message. The answer could be activate, bring, change language, deactivate, decrease, or increase.",A. activate B. change language C. deactivate D. bring E. decrease F. increase,deactivate,"The speaker is speaking in a language that is not currently understood. 

### Explanation:
The instruction asks for the action behind the spoken message. In this case, the input provides a long string of audio data, which is difficult to analyze without additional context. The speaker's tone is not specified, and the language of the message is not immediately clear. Therefore, the response is ""the speaker is speaking in a language that is not currently understood."" This response acknowledges that the instruction is incomplete and requires further information to complete the task. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the `incomplete` keyword is a useful tool for identifying incomplete or missing information in a text. It can be used to improve the accuracy of natural language processing tasks and to facilitate communication between humans and machines. However, it is important to use the `incomplete` keyword judiciously, as it can also be overused and lead to confusion or misunderstanding. 

## Exercises

1. Write a Python function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of strings that contain the word ""incomplete"". Use list comprehension to implement this function.

```python
def incomplete_strings(lst):
    return [s for s in lst if ""incomplete"" in s.lower()]
```

2. Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string contains an incomplete instruction, and False otherwise. Use the `incomplete` keyword to implement this function.

```python
def has_incomplete(s):
    return ""incomplete"" in s.lower()
```

3. Write a Python script that reads a text file and identifies all sentences that contain an incomplete instruction. Use the `incomplete` keyword and the `sent_tokenize` function from the `nltk` library to tokenize the text into sentences.

```python
import nltk

with open(""text.txt"") as f:
    text = f.read()

sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text)
incomplete_sentences = [s for s in sentences if ""incomplete"" in s.lower()]
```

The format consists of two components: the first component is a sequence of numbers that represent the frequency of each frame in the audio signal, and the second component is a sequence of numbers that represent the amplitude of each frame in the audio signal. The numbers are separated by a colon (:), and each frame is separated by a semicolon (;). The first frame of the input is:

00144:

This means that the first frame of the input has a frequency of 144 Hz and a peak amplitude of 1. The frequency of a frame is the number of cycles of the sound wave that occur in one second, measured in hertz (Hz). The peak amplitude of a frame is the maximum value of the sound wave, measured in decibels (dB). A frame with a frequency of 144 Hz and a peak amplitude of 1 would produce a sound that is in the middle range of human hearing, with a low pitch and a moderate loudness.

The second frame of the input is:

00240:

This means that the second frame of the input has a frequency of 240 Hz and a peak amplitude of 1. The frequency and the amplitude of a frame are the same as the first frame, because the input is a simple sequence of sound frames with no variation or modulation.

The third frame of the input is:

00240:

This means that the third frame of the input has a frequency of 240 Hz and a peak amplitude of 1. The frequency and the amplitude of a frame are the same as the second frame, because the input is a simple sequence of sound frames with no variation or modulation.

The answer could be activate, bring, change language, deactivate, decrease, or increase.",A. activate B. change language C. deactivate D. bring E. decrease F. increase,activate,"The input above is a transcription of an audio sample. The task at hand is to discern the action being conveyed through the speech. The options provided are to activate, bring, change language, deactivate, decrease, or increase.

To complete this task, we can first remove any non-speech sounds such as background noise or clicks. Then, we can use a speech-to-text API such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text to convert the audio into text. Once we have the text, we can analyze it to identify the action being conveyed.

For example, if the text reads ""turn off the lights"", then the action being conveyed is deactivation. If the text reads ""increase the volume"", then the action being conveyed is increase. If the text reads ""change the language to Spanish"", then the action being conveyed is language change.

We can implement this in Python using the following code:

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

# initialize the speech recognizer
r = sr.Recognizer()

# read the audio file
with sr.AudioFile('audio_file.wav') as source:
    audio = r.record(source)

# remove background noise
clean_audio = r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(audio)

# convert audio to text
text = r.recognize_google(clean_audio)

# analyze text to identify action
if 'turn off' in text:
    action = 'deactivation'
elif 'increase' in text:
    action = 'increase'
elif 'change' in text:
    action = 'language change'
else:
    action = 'unknown'

print(f'The action being conveyed is: {action}')
```

### Follow-up Exercises:

1. How can we improve the accuracy of the speech recognition?
2. What are some other speech-to-text APIs we can use besides Google Cloud Speech-to-Text?
3. How can we handle cases where the speech is in a different language than the one we are analyzing?",Incorrect

The underlying action of the spoken words is to activate the device. This can be determined by identifying the first word of the response, which is ""activate"". The word ""activate"" means to set something in motion or to make it operational.

## Explanation

The response to the instruction ""Speech2Text"" is to activate the device. This means that the device is ready to receive and process the spoken words and convert them into text. The device is activated by pressing the power button or by saying ""activate"" to the device. This enables the device to function and perform its intended purpose.",Incorrect

```

### Output:

The action conveyed through the speech is bring.

### Explanation:

The given input is a sequence of audio frames, and the task is to discern the action conveyed through the speech. To solve this task, we can use the speech recognition module of the `speech_recognition` library in Python. The `recognize_google` function of the `speech_recognition` library can recognize speech from a microphone or a file. We can use this function to recognize the action conveyed through the speech.

In the given input, the action conveyed through the speech is 'bring'.

### Follow-up Exercise 1:

What is the time duration of the audio input in seconds?

### Follow-up Solution 1:

We can find the time duration of the audio input in seconds by calculating the difference between the first and the last time stamp of the audio frames. Here is the Python code to calculate the time duration of the audio input in seconds:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the time stamps of the audio frames
time_stamps = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,",Incorrect

    file_path = os.path.join('audio/', audio_file)
    if os.path.isfile(file_path) and len(audio_file) > 6 and'm' in audio_file:
        filtered_audio_files.append(audio_file)

print(filtered_audio_files)

1. Write a Python program that takes a text file and a list of words to search for. The program should read the file and return the positions of the words in the text.

```python
import re

def search_file(file_path, words):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()

words = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
positions = search_file(file_path, words)
print(positions)
```

2. Write a Python program that takes a text file and removes all occurrences of a specific word from it. The program should read the file, remove the word, and write the modified text to a new file.

```python
import re

def remove_word(file_path, word):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()
    text = re.sub(r'\b' + word + r'\b', '', text)
    with open('new_file.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write(text)

file_path ='sample.txt'
word = 'apple'
remove_word(file_path, word)
```

3. Write a Python program that reads a CSV file and extracts a specific column of data. The program should read the file, extract the column, and print it.

```python
