"Timpco, a retailer, makes both cash and credit sales (i.e., sales on open account). Information regarding budgeted sales for the last quarter of the year is as follows: <image 1> Past experience shows that 5 percent of credit sales are uncollectible. Of the credit sales that are collectible, 60 percent are collected in the month of sale; the remaining 40 percent are collected in the month following the month of sale. Customers are granted a 1.5 percent discount for payment within 10 days of billing. Approximately 75 percent of collectible credit sales take advantage of the cash discount. Inventory purchases each month are 100 percent of the cost of the following month's projected sales. (The gross profit rate for Timpco is approximately 30 percent.) All merchandise purchases are made on credit, with 25 percent paid in the month of purchase and the remainder paid in the following month. No cash discounts for early payment are available.

"Room registrations in the Toronto Towers Plaza Hotel have been recorded for the past 9 years. To project future occupancy, management would like to determine the mathematical trend of guest registration. This estimate will help the hotel determine whether future expansion will be needed. Given the following time-series data, develop a regression equation relating registrations to time (e.g., a trend equation). Then forecast year 11 registrations. Room registrations are in the thousands: <image 1>",A. 27010 B. 27020 C. 27030 D. 27040,C,<img_03277> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428> <img_12428>,Incorrect
"<image 1> is The process of divergence and convergence, the divergence-convergence process is sequential, divergence precedes convergence, as shown in the figure. You first unfold like a fruiting tree, and then some of the broad changes you produce converge on new, innovative products. Note that many divergent ideas end up going nowhere, so what do critics complain about?",A. No need to diverge B. Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent C. Convergence proceeds too slowly D.

"Email #1: E-mail from Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing to Legislative Consultant and Staff Researcher: The results of the last election are a concern for us. The candidates we supported were defeated in more than two-thirds of the races we followed. The result is a harder battle to get policies that benefit our interests through the legislature, but it's also a budget issue. We can't continue throwing money at races we can't win, no matter how agreeable the candidate's stand on our issues may be. The fact that they share our viewpoints doesn't help if they can't get elected. How can we determine where it makes sense to invest? E-mail #2: E-mail from Legislative Consultant to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Staff Researcher: The demographic breakdown of elections where we supported the unsuccessful candidate can tell us a great deal. We've won only in one demographic, and our margin there is smaller than the margins by which we lost the others. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Staff Researcher to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Legislative Consultant: The demographic groups in which we lost are on track to become a majority of the U.S. electorate this century, and they vote. Right now, they make up 37% of the overall population and 28% of voters in the last election. By midcentury, we can expect the Hispanic population to rise from 17% to about 29% of the U.S. population, and Asian-Americans, now about 5%, will be about 9%. Our one successful demographic is the one whose share is declining. Now 63% of the population, non-Hispanic whites will be less than half of the population by 2050. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported candidates whose policy positions did not appeal to ethnic minorities.",A.

"Email #1: E-mail from Marketing Manager to Research Staff: With ABC Oil currently the most profitable corporation in the country, followed closely by XYZ Oil, how valid is the image of the United States as dependent on foreign oil? What proportion of American energy needs can be met through domestic production? How do current production levels compare with previous years? What do we know about trends in demand? And if we must import, how much of that need can be answered by Canada? Positioning the company as an American energy company would be the most positive stance but only if we can support it by showing that our product comes from if not U.S. wells at least North American sources. E-mail #2: E-mail from Researcher #1 to Marketing Manager: Domestic production is healthy, but while it may be true that U.S.-based companies now produce more than the United States imports, we certainly don't produce as much as we consume, as you can see in the following graph. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Researcher #2 to Marketing Manager: ABC Oil's headquarters may be in Texas, but it sources crude from 21 countries, including both relatively stable nations like Kazakhstan and nations with periodic violent crises like Chad. XYZ Oil's practices are similar. We're a global society now, and an ""American"" company just means where the company pays taxes, not necessarily where it produces. The United States consumes more than 18 million barrels of crude per day, but our local fields produce less than half that. The difference has to come from fields somewhere else, no matter what company owns them. This isn't local farming where you eat what's grown close to home. We may be able to focus attention on our ties to American plants and American workers, but the product is an international mix. Consider the following statement.

"Email #1: E-mail from Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing to Legislative Consultant and Staff Researcher: The results of the last election are a concern for us. The candidates we supported were defeated in more than two-thirds of the races we followed. The result is a harder battle to get policies that benefit our interests through the legislature, but it's also a budget issue. We can't continue throwing money at races we can't win, no matter how agreeable the candidate's stand on our issues may be. The fact that they share our viewpoints doesn't help if they can't get elected. How can we determine where it makes sense to invest? E-mail #2: E-mail from Legislative Consultant to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Staff Researcher: The demographic breakdown of elections where we supported the unsuccessful candidate can tell us a great deal. We've won only in one demographic, and our margin there is smaller than the margins by which we lost the others. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Staff Researcher to Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing and Legislative Consultant: The demographic groups in which we lost are on track to become a majority of the U.S. electorate this century, and they vote. Right now, they make up 37% of the overall population and 28% of voters in the last election. By midcentury, we can expect the Hispanic population to rise from 17% to about 29% of the U.S. population, and Asian-Americans, now about 5%, will be about 9%. Our one successful demographic is the one whose share is declining. Now 63% of the population, non-Hispanic whites will be less than half of the population by 2050. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: The legislative consultant will actively lobby Asian-American legislators, because the candidates that E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing supported were more successful with Asian-Americans than with other minority groups.",A. Yes B.
