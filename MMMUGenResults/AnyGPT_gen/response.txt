Statement 1 | A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian. Statement 2 | If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.

A. True, True
B. False, False
C. True, False
D. False, True

Please answer by choosing the correct option: A,B,C,D. Please give explanations. Note that the term Abelian group is sometimes used to mean subgroup, the distinction is not always clear. Statement 1 is not true for ∇ since the identity element is not a factor of the group. Note also that the subgroup of a non-abelian group is not necessarily non-Abelian. If K ⊂ G, H then K is Abelian if and only if K is a proper subgroup of G. In the particular example above, G is
