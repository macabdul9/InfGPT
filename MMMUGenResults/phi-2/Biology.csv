Reto Zach studied the whelk-eating behavior of the Northwestern crow. Below are two flight paths that the crow could assume when eating whelks: <image 1>. Select the flight path that would be used most often and the response that best supports your answer.,A. Flight Path A: the crow has a wider view of his surroundings to assure that another bird will not steal the whelk B. Flight Path A: the crow is maximizing the height to drop the whelk C. Flight Path A: the crow is adding force to the downward movement to the whelk by flying higher D. Flight Path B: the crow can see where the whelk lands E. Flight Path B: the crow is throwing the whelk to the ground,A,

"A student placed 20 tobacco seeds of the same species on moist paper towels in each of two petri dishes. Dish A was wrapped completely in an opaque cover to exclude all light. Dish B was not wrapped. The dishes were placed equidistant from a light source set to a cycle of 14 h of light and 10 h of dark. All other conditions were the same for both dishes. The dishes were examined after seven days, and the opaque cover was permanently removed from dish A. Both dishes were returned to the light and examined again at 14 days. The following data were obtained: <image 1> What best describes the usefulness of the yellow-leaved phenotype as a variation subject to natural selection?",A. The yellow-leaved phenotype can germinate in environments without light. B. The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is unaffected by light intensity. C. The germination of the yellow-leaved phenotype is accelerated as compared to the green-leaved phenotype. D. The yellow-leaved phenotype cannot germinate in environments with light.,A,>

"<image 1> In Ayrshire cattle, the mahogany/red locus is an autosomal gene. In both sexes, mahogany homozygotes are mahogany colored, and red homozygotes are red. However, the mahogany/red heterozygote is mahogany if male and red if female. Here is a pedigree for an Ayrshire family that is of great interest to Farmer MacDonald. (In the pedigree, open circles and squares indicate the mahogany phenotype; filled indicate red.) Although Elmer has long ago become a huge pile of Big Macs, Farmer MacDonald has frozen a good supply of Elmer's semen and has used it to artificially inseminate Elmira.

"The RB gene encodes the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Note: As shown in <image 1>, the dephosphorylated pRB protein is active in G1 phase. pRB binds to the transcription factor E2F and prevents E2F mediated G1->S transition. The Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex produced during G1, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates pRB. This allows the cell to enter S phase. The p16 protein inhibits the Cyclin D-Cdk4 complex. In which process are the proteins encoded by the target genes of E2F most likely to function? ",A. DNA replication B. RNA stabilization C. Splicing D. Transcription E. Translation,A,
