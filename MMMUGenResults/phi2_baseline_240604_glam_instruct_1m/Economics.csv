"<image 1> Suppose the government decided that, since gasoline is a necessity, its price should be legally capped at $1.30 per gallon. What do you anticipate would be the outcome in the gasoline market?",A. A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a surplus. B. A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a shortage. C. Not certain.,B,"A. A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a surplus. This means that there would be more people wanting to buy gasoline than there is gasoline available to meet that demand. As a result, the price of gasoline would likely increase, and businesses would need to pay more for their gasoline supplies. This could lead to higher costs for consumers and businesses, as well as a decrease in profitability for oil companies.

B. A price below that of 1.30 dollars would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a surplus. This means that there would be more people wanting to buy gasoline than there is gasoline available to meet that demand. As a result, the price of gasoline would likely decrease, and businesses would need to pay less for their gasoline supplies. This could lead to lower costs for consumers and businesses, as well as an increase in profitability for oil companies.

C. Not certain. The outcome of this situation would depend on various factors, such as the elasticity of demand for gasoline, the availability of alternative fuels, and the effectiveness of government policies to manage the supply and demand of gasoline. If the demand for gasoline is relatively inelastic, meaning that people will continue to buy gasoline even if the price increases, then the outcome could be similar to option A. However, if the demand for gasoline is elastic, meaning that people are more sensitive to changes in the price of gasoline, then the outcome could be similar to option B. Additionally, if there are alternative fuels available, such as electric vehicles, that can effectively replace gasoline in some cases, then the demand for gasoline could decrease, leading to a surplus. Ultimately, the outcome would depend on the specific circumstances of the situation and the behavior of consumers and businesses."
"<image 1> Table 10.7 provides some hypothetical data on macroeconomic accounts for three countries represented by A, B, and C and measured in billions of currency units. In Table 10.7, private household saving is SH, tax revenue is T, government spending is G, and investment spending is I. Calculate the trade balance and the net inflow of foreign saving for each country(country A,B,C).","A. -700,250,0 B. -700,250,-100 C. -600,350,-100 D. -700,350,0",A,"The trade balance is the difference between the value of a country's exports and the value of its imports.
The net inflow of foreign saving is the sum of all the money coming into a country from outside, including foreign investment.
The trade balance and the net inflow of foreign saving can be positive, negative, or zero. A positive trade balance means that a country's exports are higher than its imports, and the net inflow of foreign saving is positive. A negative trade balance means that a country's exports are lower than its imports, and the net inflow of foreign saving is negative. A zero trade balance means that a country's exports and imports are equal.
The table shows that the trade balance for each country is negative. This means that the value of A's exports is lower than the value of B's exports, and the value of B's exports is higher than the value of C's exports. The net inflow of foreign saving is the sum of the value of A's exports and the value of C's exports, which is equal to zero.
So, the trade balance for each country is negative."

"Suppose that your demand schedule for DVDs is as follows: <image 1> what is your price elasticity of demand as the price of DVDs increases from $8 to $10 if your income is $12,000?",A. 0.17 B. 0.27 C. 0.37 D. 0.47,D,"Based on the image, it appears that the price of DVDs has not changed significantly from $8 to $10. The price elasticity of demand, which measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price, is 0.0. This means that the change in price does not correspond to a proportional change in quantity demanded. In other words, the demand for DVDs remains constant when the price changes from $8 to $10."
The graph below shows the AD-AS diagram for Spain. All numbers are in billions. <image 1> What is the size of real GDP in the short-run equilibrium?,A. 500 B. 450 C. 400 D. 600,C,"The size of real GDP in the short-run equilibrium is represented by the blue line in the graph. This line shows the change in real GDP from one period to another, taking into account the changes in consumer spending, investment, and government spending. In this case, the blue line indicates that the Spanish economy experienced a decline in real GDP between 2008 and 2009. This decline was due to the global financial crisis, which affected consumer spending, investment, and overall economic activity in Spain.

The short-run equilibrium is the point at which the economy adjusts to the initial change in real GDP and returns to a steady state. In other words, it is the point where the economy's output reaches a new, steady level after the initial shock or change in real GDP. In this case, the Spanish economy reached its short-run equilibrium in the years following the 2008-2009 recession, as the country gradually recovered from the economic downturn and adjusted to the new normal.

In summary, the size of real GDP in the short-run equilibrium for Spain is represented by the blue line in the graph, which shows a decline in real GDP between 2008 and 2009. However, the Spanish economy has since recovered and returned to its short-run equilibrium."

"The market for pizza has the following demand and supply schedules:<image 1> If the actual price in this market were above the equilibrium price, what would drive the market toward the equilibrium?",A. excess supply B. excess demand C. both D. neither,A,"If the actual price of pizza in the market were above the equilibrium price, the market would drive toward the equilibrium by increasing the price of pizza. This would lead to a higher demand for pizza, as consumers would be willing to pay the higher price to obtain the pizza at a lower cost. The market would then adjust the supply of pizza to meet the increased demand, ensuring that the market reaches a new equilibrium where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded."
Why is it probable that a monopoly exists in this market? <image 1>,A. There are decreasing returns to scale well beyond the size of the market.  B. There are increasing returns to scale well beyond the size of the market.  C. There are constant returns to scale well beyond the size of the market. ,B,"It is probable that a monopoly exists in this market because there is only one store selling bananas. The image shows a large bunch of bananas hanging from the ceiling of the store, and the store appears to be very full. Monopolies often arise when there is a lack of competition, allowing a single company to dominate the market and control prices, profits, and product offerings. In this case, the store selling bananas seems to be the only option for consumers, suggesting that the market might be dominated by a single company with limited competition."

The graph below shows the Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curves (LRAS) for Brazil. <image 1> What event could shift LRAS from LRAS1 (black color) to LRAS2 (red color) in Brazil (select one)?,A. Increase in capital. B. Decrease in labor. C. Decrease in human capital.,A,"The event that could shift LRAS1 (black color) to LRAS2 (red color) in Brazil is an increase in capital. In the image, the LRAS1 curve shows a black line, while the LRAS2 curve shows a red line. This indicates that the capital is not increasing at the same rate as the population, which is expected to increase. A shift in LRAS1 to LRAS2 could be attributed to an increase in capital investment, which would lead to an expansion in production capacity and an increase in the supply of goods and services. This would result in a shift in the LRAS1 curve to the right, indicating an increase in the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)."
"Consider a prisoners' dilemma game by two oligopolist, which strategy is dominant? <image 1>",A. Dominant strategy is 'High output' (low price) for both firms. B. Dominant strategy is 'Low output' (high price) for both firms. C. Dominant strategy is 'High output' (low price) for one of the firms and 'Low output' (high price) for the other.,A,"In the prisoners' dilemma game, the dominant strategy for both firms is to choose the strategy that maximizes their own payoff. In the image, the two firms are represented by the letters A and B. The payoff for each firm depends on the strategy chosen by the other firm. If both firms choose the dominant strategy, which is to choose the strategy that yields the highest payoff for each firm, the outcome will be a Nash equilibrium.

In this case, the payoff for firm A is represented by the letter P, and the payoff for firm B is represented by the letter Q. If both firms choose the dominant strategy, the payoff for each firm will be P = Q.

However, if one firm chooses the dominant strategy and the other firm chooses the other strategy, the payoff for each firm will be P = Q, but the other firm will have an advantage over the first firm.

In summary, the dominant strategy for both firms in the prisoners' dilemma game is to choose the strategy that yields the highest payoff for each firm."
The graph below shows the supply and demand curves and the world price for bagels. <image 1> What is the equilibrium price if this country does not trade?,,8,"The equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. In the case of bagels, the equilibrium price is the price at which the market clears, meaning that the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded. In the graph, the supply and demand curves intersect at this price, indicating that the equilibrium price for bagels is $2.50. If the supply and demand curves do not intersect, then the market is not at equilibrium, and the price will continue to rise or fall until it reaches the equilibrium price."

The null must be rejected at the 5% significance level. B. The null cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level. C. There is not enough information in the problem statement to test this null.,C,"Based on the results in Model 2, the null that the Coefficient associated to a level C3 branch is equal to that of a C4 branch cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level. This means that there is no evidence to suggest that the two branches are equivalent in terms of the observed data. The null hypothesis, which states that the coefficient is equal to zero, cannot be rejected, and the data does not support the claim that the two branches are the same."
"Suppose that the price of basketball tickets at your college is determined by market forces. Currently, the demand and supply schedules are as follows: <image 1> Your college plans to increase total enrollment next year by 5,000 students. The additional students will have the following demand schedule: <image 2> Now add the old demand schedule and the demand schedule for the new students to calculate the new demand schedule for the entire college. What will be the new equilibrium quantity?",A. 6000 B. 7000 C. 8000 D. 9000,C,"To determine the new equilibrium quantity, we need to compare the old and new demand schedules. The old demand schedule shows a quantity of 100 tickets sold at $10 each, while the new demand schedule shows a quantity of 150 tickets sold at $8 each. 

Let's calculate the change in quantity:
New quantity - Old quantity = 150 - 100 = 50

Now, let's calculate the new equilibrium quantity:
New equilibrium quantity = New quantity / (old quantity / old quantity + new quantity / old quantity)
New equilibrium quantity = 150 / (100 / 100 + 150 / 100) = 75

So, the new equilibrium quantity is 75 basketball tickets."
"Consider a consumption function, what happens to the consumption-line C in graph 1 if (1) a rises; (2) b rises? <image 1>",A. C shifts upwards.  B. (1)C shifts downwards. (2) C gets gentler. C. (1)C gets steeper. (2) C gets gentler. D. (1)C shifts downwards. (2) )C gets steeper.,A,"If (1) a rises, then the consumption-line C in graph 1 will shift upwards. This means that the quantity of the good demanded by consumers will increase as the price of the good increases.

If (2) b rises, then the consumption-line C in graph 1 will shift downwards. This means that the quantity of the good demanded by consumers will decrease as the price of the good increases.

If (1) a rises and (2) b rises, then the consumption-line C in graph 1 will shift upwards and downwards simultaneously. This means that the quantity of the good demanded by consumers will fluctuate as the price of the good changes.

If (1) does not rise and (2) does not rise, then the consumption-line C in graph 1 will remain constant. This means that the quantity of the good demanded by consumers will remain the same as the price of the good increases and decreases.

In summary, if (1) a rises, then the consumption-line C in graph 1 will shift upwards. If (2) b rises, then the consumption-line C in graph 1 will shift downwards. If (1) does not rise and (2) does not rise, then the consumption-line C in graph 1 will remain constant."
