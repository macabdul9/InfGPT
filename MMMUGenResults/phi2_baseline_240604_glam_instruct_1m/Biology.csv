"<image 1> If the pH outside the cell decreases, would you expect the amount of amino acids transported into the cell to increase or decrease?",A. increase B. decrease,A,"If the pH outside the cell decreases, it would likely decrease the amount of amino acids transported into the cell. This is because a lower pH can affect the functioning of the protein pepsin, which is responsible for breaking down proteins into their individual amino acids. When the pH is too low, pepsin may not be able to function properly, reducing its ability to break down proteins effectively. As a result, fewer amino acids would be available for the cell to use for growth and maintenance.",Incorrect

"Using the figure, which two groups will form a strong ionic bond? <image 1>",A. Group 1 and Group 17 B. Group 1 and Group 14 C. Group 14 and Group 18 D. Group 1 and Group 18,A,"Based on the figure, Group 1 and Group 17 will form a strong ionic bond. This is because Group 1, also known as the alkali metals, consists of lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), and caesium (Cs), while Group 17, also known as the halogens, consists of fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), iodine (I), and caesium (Cs). These groups are known for their high electronegativity values, which means they attract electrons from other atoms. When lithium (Li) reacts with fluorine (F), they form a strong ionic bond, as the electronegative nature of fluorine attracts the electrons from lithium, creating a stable octet of electrons in the outer shell of lithium. Similarly, when beryllium (Be) reacts with chlorine (Cl), they form a strong ionic bond, as chlorine attracts the electrons from beryllium, creating a stable octet of electrons in the outer shell of beryllium. The same can be said for boron (B) and iodine (I), as they also form strong ionic bonds with other elements.

In summary, Group 1 and Group 17 will form a strong ionic bond when their atoms react with each other, as both groups have high electronegativity values and can attract electrons to create stable octets in their outer shells.",Correct
