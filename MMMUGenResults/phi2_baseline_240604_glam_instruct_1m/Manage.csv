"Room registrations in the Toronto Towers Plaza Hotel have been recorded for the past 9 years. To project future occupancy, management would like to determine the mathematical trend of guest registration. This estimate will help the hotel determine whether future expansion will be needed. Given the following time-series data, develop a regression equation relating registrations to time (e.g., a trend equation). Then forecast year 11 registrations. Room registrations are in the thousands: <image 1>",A. 27010 B. 27020 C. 27030 D. 27040,C,"A regression equation relates two variables, in this case, room registrations and time. The equation takes the form of:

Room Registrations = b0 + b1 * Time

where b0 is the y-intercept and b1 is the slope of the line.

To forecast year 11 registrations, we can use the equation of the regression line to estimate the expected number of room registrations for that year. We can plug in the values for the year 11 and the y-intercept to get the predicted number of room registrations.

For example, if the y-intercept is 0 and the slope of the line is 2, then the equation becomes:

Room Registrations = 0 + 2 * 11 = 22

This means that, based on the data from the past 9 years, we can expect to see 22 room registrations for year 11. Of course, this is just an estimate, and actual room registrations may vary.",Incorrect

"Email #1: E-mail from Vice President of E.A.S.Y. Manufacturing to Legislative Consultant and Staff Researcher: The results of the last election are a concern for us. The candidates we supported were defeated in more than two-thirds of the races we followed. The result is a harder battle to get policies that benefit our interests through the legislature, but it's also a budget issue. We can't continue throwing money at races we can't win, no matter how agreeable the candidate's stand on our issues may be. The fact that they share our viewpoints doesn't help if they can't get elected. How can we determine where it makes sense to invest?

"Email #1: E-mail from Marketing Manager to Research Staff: With ABC Oil currently the most profitable corporation in the country, followed closely by XYZ Oil, how valid is the image of the United States as dependent on foreign oil? What proportion of American energy needs can be met through domestic production? How do current production levels compare with previous years? What do we know about trends in demand? And if we must import, how much of that need can be answered by Canada? Positioning the company as an American energy company would be the most positive stance but only if we can support it by showing that our product comes from if not U.S. wells at least North American sources. E-mail #2: E-mail from Researcher #1 to Marketing Manager: Domestic production is healthy, but while it may be true that U.S.-based companies now produce more than the United States imports, we certainly don't produce as much as we consume, as you can see in the following graph. <image 1> E-mail #3: E-mail from Researcher #2 to Marketing Manager: ABC Oil's headquarters may be in Texas, but it sources crude from 21 countries, including both relatively stable nations like Kazakhstan and nations with periodic violent crises like Chad. XYZ Oil's practices are similar. We're a global society now, and an ""American"" company just means where the company pays taxes, not necessarily where it produces. The United States consumes more than 18 million barrels of crude per day, but our local fields produce less than half that. The difference has to come from fields somewhere else, no matter what company owns them. This isn't local farming where you eat what's grown close to home. We may be able to focus attention on our ties to American plants and American workers, but the product is an international mix. Consider the following statement. Does the information in the three sources support the inference as stated? Statement: The idea of ""American"" oil companies is archaic because major oil companies are now operating in global industries.",A. Yes B. No,A,"The image of the United States as dependent on foreign oil is not entirely accurate. While it is true that the U.S. imports a significant portion of its oil, the image does not provide enough information to determine the exact proportion or the exact source of that oil. Additionally, the term ""dependent"" implies that the country relies solely on imports for its energy needs, which is not necessarily the case. The United States has made significant strides in diversifying its energy sources, including the development of renewable energy technologies and the expansion of natural gas and shale gas production. As a result, the country has become less reliant on foreign oil, and the exact extent of this reduction cannot be accurately determined from the image alone.",Incorrect

It has established standard costs for making one of these fishing nets as shown below: <image 1> The fixed overhead rate is based on normal monthly activity of 120,000 direct labor hours. Last month 19,500 nets were produced. There had been no initial inventories. The total costs of production were: <image 2> Find the variance of price.",,2960,"To find the variance of the prices of the deluxe net, calculate the standard deviation of the prices. The standard deviation is the measure of how spread out the prices are.

First, calculate the mean price of the deluxe nets. To do this, add up all the prices and divide by the number of prices. Let's say the mean price is $50.

Then, for each price, subtract the mean price and square the result. This will give you a number between -50 and 50.

Next, take the sum of all these squared numbers and divide by the number of prices. Let's say the sum is 2500.

Finally, take the square root of this sum to find the variance. The variance is the measure of how spread out the prices are. The square root of 2500 is 50.

So, the variance of the prices of the deluxe nets is 50.

The answer is A",Incorrect

"The estimated times and immediate predecessors for the activities in a project at George Kyparis's retinal scanning company are given in the following table. Assume that the activity times are independent. <image 1> If the time to complete path B-D is normally distributed, what is the probability that this path will be finished in 22 weeks or less?",,0.963,"To determine the probability that the activity time of path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less, we need to calculate the mean time it takes for the activity to complete. Since the activity times are given in terms of hours, we can convert them to days and then calculate the mean time.

First, let's convert the activity times to days:
- Activity A: 5 hours x (1 day / 5 hours) = 1 day
- Activity B: 5 hours x (1 day / 5 hours) = 1 day
- Activity C: 5 hours x (1 day / 5 hours) = 1 day
- Activity D: 5 hours x (1 day / 5 hours) = 1 day

Now, let's calculate the mean time it takes for the activities to be finished:
- Mean time = (1 day + 1 day + 1 day + 1 day) / 4 = 1.25 days

Since the mean time is 1.25 days, we can calculate the probability that path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less using the exponential function:

P(B-D finished in 22 weeks or less) = e^(-mean time)

Plugging in the mean time value of 1.25 days, we get:

P(B-D finished in 22 weeks or less) = e^(-1.25 days) ≈ 0.5

Therefore, the probability that path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less is approximately 0.5.",Incorrect
