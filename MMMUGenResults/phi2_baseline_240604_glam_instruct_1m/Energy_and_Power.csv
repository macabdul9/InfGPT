"<image 1>A transistor, which may be approximated as a hemispherical heat source of radius ro = 0.1 mm, is embedded in a large silicon substrate (k = 125 W/m$\cdot$  K) and dissipates heat at a rate q. All boundaries of the silicon are maintained at an ambient temperature of T$\infty$= 27C,except for the top surface, which is well insulated.evaluate the surface temperature of the heat source for q =4 W.",A. 340.93K B. 350.93K C. 360.93K,B,"A transistor, which may be approximated as a hemispherical heat source of radius ro = 0.1 mm, is embedded in a large silicon substrate (k = 125 W/m$\cdot$  K) and dissipates heat at a rate q. All boundaries of the silicon are maintained at an ambient temperature of T$\infty$= 27C,except for the top surface, which is well insulated.

The surface temperature of the heat source can be calculated using the formula:

T = (q / (k * T)) + T

where:
T = ambient temperature
q = heat dissipated by the heat source
k = heat conductivity of the silicon substrate
T = temperature of the heat source

Substituting the given values into the formula, we get:

T = (4 W / (125 W/m$\cdot$  K)) + 27C
T = 0.08 K

Therefore, the surface temperature of the heat source is 0.08 K."

A 14-in-diameter hollow sphere of steel (SG = 7.85) has 0.16 in wall thickness. How much weight must be added inside to make the sphere neutrally buoyant? <image 1>,A. 15 lbf B. 50 lbf C. 25 lbf,C,"To make the 14-in-diameter hollow sphere neutrally buoyant, you would need to add a certain amount of weight to balance the buoyant force exerted by the water. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the sphere. Since the sphere has a diameter of 7.85 inches and a volume of approximately 4.5 cubic inches, the volume of water displaced would be approximately 4.5 x 4.5 = 22.5 cubic inches.

To balance the buoyant force, the weight of the sphere must be equal to the weight of the water displaced. The weight of the sphere can be calculated using the formula: Weight = Density x Volume. Since the sphere is hollow and has a diameter of 7.85 inches, its volume can be calculated as follows: Volume = (4/3) x π x (diameter/2)^2 = (4/3) x π x (7.85/2)^2 = 14.5 x π x 3.5 x 2 = 98.75π x 3.5 = 261.75π x 3.5 = 818.75π x 3.5 = 2,827.5π x 3.5 = 2,827.5π x 3.5 = 20,268π x 3.5 = 5,858.5π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 68,858π x 3.5 = 190,858π x 3.5 = 5,858π x 3.5 = 20,337π x 3.5 = 5,858π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 5,858π x 3.5 = 20,337π x 3.5 = 5,858π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 5,858π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 5,858π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3.5 = 22,337π x 3"

An ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle that uses refrigerant-134a as its working fluid maintains a condenser at 800 kPa and the evaporator at 212°C. Determine this system's COP and the amount of power required to service a 150 kW cooling load.<image 1>,"A. 4.07, 31.8 kW B. 4.97, 33.8 kW C. 4.87, 30.8 kW",C,"The ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle that uses refrigerant-134a as its working fluid maintains a condenser at 800 kPa and an evaporator at 212°C. The COP (cooperative efficiency) of this system can be calculated using the formula:

COP = (enthalpy of evaporation / (enthalpy of vaporization + sensible heat of the process))

For the given system, the COP can be calculated as:

COP = (8.5 kJ/kg - (-0.5 kJ/kg) + 0.5 kJ/kg) / (8.5 kJ/kg - (-0.5 kJ/kg) + 0.5 kJ/kg)

COP = (8.5 kJ/kg - (-0.5 kJ/kg) + 0.5 kJ/kg) / (8.5 kJ/kg - (-0.5 kJ/kg) + 0.5 kJ/kg)

COP = (8.5 kJ/kg - 0.5 kJ/kg) / (8.5 kJ/kg - 0.5 kJ/kg)

COP = 7.5 kPa

The amount of power required to service a 150 kW cooling load in this system can be calculated using the formula:

Power = (Cooling load in kW) x (Cooling capacity in kW) / (COP)

Power = 150 kW x 150 kW / 7.5 kPa

Power = 2250 kW

Therefore, the ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle that uses refrigerant-134a as its working fluid maintains a condenser at 800 kPa and an evaporator at 212°C will have a COP of 7.5, and the amount of power required to service a 150 kW cooling load can be calculated as 2250 kW."

A 40-ft^3 adiabatic container is initially evacuated. The supply line contains air that is maintained at 150 psia and 90°F. The valve is opened until the pressure in the container is the same as the pressure in the supply line. Determine the work potential of the air in this container when it is filled. Take T0 = 80°F.<image 1>,A. W=817Btu B. W=917Btu C. W=1017Btu,B,"The work potential of the air in the container is determined by the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the container. In the image, the container is filled with air at a pressure of 100 psi, and the outside pressure is 100 psi. The work potential is calculated by subtracting the pressure inside the container from the pressure outside. In this case, the work potential is 100 psi.

The work potential of the air in the container can be used to determine the efficiency of the container in maintaining a constant pressure. If the container is not able to maintain a constant pressure, then the work potential will increase, leading to a decrease in efficiency. In this case, the container appears to be able to maintain a constant pressure, which indicates that it is an efficient container for storing and transporting air."
A commercial refrigerator with refrigerant-134a as the working fluid is used to keep the refrigerated space at230°C by rejecting its waste heat to cooling water that enters the condenser at 18°C at a rate of 0.25 kg/s and leaves at 26°C.

This can be calculated using the formula Q = p_1 * (R_1 / R_2), where Q is the flow rate, p_1 is the gage pressure at the source, R_1 is the distance from the source to the pipe, and R_2 is the distance from the pipe to the end user. In this case, the gage pressure is 2.38E6 Pa, and the distance is 1.5 meters.

The flow rate is the amount of water that passes through the hose per unit of time. In this case, the flow rate is 0.625-in-diameter hose per minute.

The pressure at which water flows through a hose is determined by the flow rate and the resistance of the hose. The resistance of a hose depends on its material and thickness. For a 0.625-in-diameter hose, the minimum gage pressure required to reach the garden is calculated using the formula:

Pressure = Flow Rate x (Resistance x (1/2) + (1/2) x (gauge pressure / Diameter))

Where:
Flow Rate = 0.625-in-diameter hose per minute
Resistance = Resistance x (1/2)

A valve in the cylinder shown in <image 1> has a cross-sectional area of 11 cm2 with a pressure of 735 kPa inside the cylinder and 99 kPa outside.How large a force is needed to open the valve?,A. F=689.4N B. F=660.5N C. F=699.6N D. F=709.6N,C,"To open the valve, a force of approximately 735.4 newtons is needed. This can be calculated using the formula for the force of a spring, which is given by F = k * x, where F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement or change in position of the spring. In this case, the spring constant k is unknown, but its value can be determined by using the given information about the compression of the spring, which is 0.5 meters. Plugging the known values into the formula, we get:

F = k * x
F = k * 0.5
F = k * 0.5
F = k * 0.25

Since the valve has a cross-sectional area of 11 cm2, the force required to open the valve can be calculated using the formula for the force exerted by a spring, which is given by F = k * x^2. Substituting the known values into the formula, we get:

F = k * x^2
F = k * 0.25
F = k * 0.05

Therefore, the force required to open the valve is approximately 5.25 newtons."

"In contrast to the liquid rocket in Fig. P3.34, the solid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.35 is self-contained and has no entrance ducts. Using a control-volume analysis for the conditions shown in Fig. P3.35, compute the rate of mass loss of the propellant, assuming that the exit gas has a molecular weight of 28. <image 1>",A. -10.0 kg/s B. -11.8 kg/s C. -12.4 kg/s,B,"The solid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.34 is self-contained and has no exit ducts. The solid propellant rocket in Fig. P3.35 is a liquid rocket, which means it requires an external source of heat to generate the necessary pressure and thrust to lift off. In the case of the liquid rocket, the heat is generated by burning a fuel, such as liquid hydrogen or liquid oxygen, in a combustion chamber. The heat causes the fuel to vaporize and expand, creating a high-pressure gas that drives the rocket upward.

In contrast, the solid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.34 does not have an external heat source. Instead, it relies on the kinetic energy of the solid propellant, such as aluminum powder, to drive the rocket upward. The solid propellant is ignited, and the expanding gas forces the solid propellant upward, propelling the rocket.

Because of the differences in their propulsion mechanisms, the solid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.34 and the liquid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.35 have different characteristics in terms of their design, construction, and operating environment. For example, the solid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.34 is smaller and has a more compact design, while the liquid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.35 is larger and has a more complex structure. Additionally, the solid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.34 does not require an exit duct, whereas the liquid-propellant rocket in Fig. P3.35 does."
