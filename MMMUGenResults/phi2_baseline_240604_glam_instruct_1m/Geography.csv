Calculate the punching shear bearing capacity Fl of the cushion cap as () kN.<image 1>",,8200,"The punching shear bearing capacity of the cushion cap can be calculated using the formula:

Punching Shear = (Pile Height x Pile Thickness) / (Column Section Size x Column Density)

Given the values for Pile Height, Pile Thickness, Column Section Size, and Column Density in the image, we can calculate the punching shear as follows:

Punching Shear = (5m x 1.2m) / (0.4m x 0.6m)
Punching Shear = 12 m/m

Therefore, the punching shear bearing capacity of the cushion cap is 12 meters per meter.",Incorrect

The outer wall roll adopts the empty laying method D.  When laying double layer coils, the two layers of coils are perpendicular to each other",A,"The correct method for constructing the waterproofing layer of the basement exterior wall with coiled materials is to use a combination of waterproofing membranes and a waterproofing system. In the image, a man is laying coiled materials on the wall, which is the first step in creating the waterproofing layer. The next step would be to apply a waterproofing membrane, such as a waterproofing board or a waterproofing paint, over the coiled materials. This membrane will help to prevent water from seeping through and reaching the underlying coiled materials. Finally, a waterproofing system, such as a drainage system or a sump pump, should be installed to ensure proper drainage and prevent water accumulation within the basement. This will help maintain a dry and healthy environment in the basement.",Incorrect
