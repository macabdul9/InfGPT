"<image 1> A major food manufacturer is concerned that the sales for its skinny french fries have been decreasing. As a part of a feasibility study, the company conducts research into the types of fries sold across the country to determine if the type of fries sold is independent of the area of the country. The results of the study are shown in Table 11.43. Conduct a test of independence. At the 5% significance level, what can you conclude?",A. There is insufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent. B. There is sufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent. C. Not certain.,B,"A major food manufacturer is concerned that the sales for its skinny french fries have been decreasing. As a part of a feasibility study, the company conducts research into the types of fries sold across the country to determine if the type of fries and location are dependent. The results of the study are shown in Table 11.43.

The test of independence indicates that the type of fries and location are indeed dependent. The results show that the type of fries sold is significantly correlated with the location of the restaurant. This means that if a major food manufacturer sells its skinny french fries to a restaurant located in a region with a higher demand for this type of fries, the sales of skinny french fries in that region will likely increase. On the other hand, if the restaurant in that region prefers to sell other types of fries or if the demand for skinny french fries is low in that area, the sales of skinny french fries in that region will likely decrease.

In conclusion, the test of independence clearly shows that the type of fries and location are dependent, as the sales of skinny french fries are significantly correlated with the region where the restaurant is located.",Incorrect
